## [Goal](#goal)

Simplify time keeping between consultants and
customers

## [Background](#background)

Working by the hour involves keeping track of
those working hours and at certain intervals transform the
accumulated time to an invoice for the customer.

Preferit is a small business with ten consultants and one
chief executive officer(CEO). Consultants report back to the
CEO on a monthly basis. He then compiles the times to one or
more invoices and sends them to customers. Sometimes the
customer is another consultantcy firm which has contracted
Preferit. Also at times when consultants are sub-contracted
this way, working hours need to be reported both to the CEO
and the other contracting firm. Sometimes it's enough for the
CEO to do it when sending the invoice, but there are
contractors who expect the consultant to report the hours
directly.

## [Current state of affairs](#currentstateofaffairs)

### [Consultant track working hours](#consultanttrackworkinghours)

Preferits consultants use excel file for gathering the
hours and reporting them to the CEO. The file is prepared in
advance by the CEO each year, with expected number of working
hours for each day. The file contains monthly
sheets and a yearly summary. Consultants register a project
per line and enter number of hours for each day. There are
also rows for vacation, illness and other non project specific
tasks that may need time tracking.

### [CEO prepares excel file for consultant](#ceopreparesexcelfileforconsultant)

Each year the CEO creates a new excel file based on a
previous one. He goes through each month and verifies that the
calendar is correct and changes the expected working hours for
holidays. Once this is done the file is duplicated for each
consultant. If the consultant has overtime left from last year
it added to this years file. The new file is then sent out to
the consultant.

### [Consultant reports working hours to CEO](#consultantreportsworkinghourstoceo)

Consultant e-mails the excel file to the CEO
### [Consultant reports working hours to contractor](#consultantreportsworkinghourstocontractor)
