## Goal

Simplify time keeping between consultants and
customers

## Background

Working by the hour involves keeping track of
those working hours and at certain intervals transform the
accumulated time to an invoice for the customer.

Preferit is a small business with ten consultants and one
chief executive officer(CEO). Consultants report back to the
CEO on a monthly basis who then further sends invoices to
customers. Sometimes the customer is another consultantcy firm
which has subcontracted us. Also at times when consultants are
subcontracted working hours need to be reported both to the
CEO and the other contracting firm.
