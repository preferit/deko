<h1>Deko project specification</h1>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>Simplify time keeping between consultants and
		customers</p>
<section class="background">
<h2>Background</h2>
Working by the hour involves keeping track of
		those working hours and at certain intervals transform the
		accumulated time to an invoice for the customer.</section>
<p>Preferit is a small business with ten consultants and one
		chief executive officer(CEO). Consultants report back to the
		CEO on a monthly basis who then further sends invoices to
		customers. Sometimes the customer is another consultantcy firm
		which has subcontracted us. Also at times when consultants are
		subcontracted working hours need to be reported both to the
		CEO and the other contracting firm.</p>
<h2>Current state of affairs</h2>
<p>Preferits consultants use excel spreadsheets for gathering
		the hours and reporting them to the CEO. The file contains
		monthly sheets and a yearly summary. Consultants register a
		project per line and enter number of hours for each day. There
		are also rows for vacation, illness and other non project
		specific tasks that may need time tracking. The file is
		prepared in advance by the CEO each year, with expected number
		of working hours for each day.</p>
