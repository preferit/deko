<h2>Background</h2>
Working by the hour involves keeping track of
		those working hours and at certain intervals transform the
		accumulated time to an invoice for the customer.</section>
<p>Preferit is a small business with ten consultants and one
		chief executive officer(CEO). Consultants report back to the
		CEO on a monthly basis who then further sends invoices to
		customers. Sometimes the customer is another consultantcy firm
		which has subcontracted us. Also at times when consultants are
		subcontracted working hours need to be reported both to the
		CEO and the other contracting firm.</p>
